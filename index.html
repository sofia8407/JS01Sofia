  <h1>Cashed Out</h1>

  <p id="visible">Imagine this.</p>
     <p id="invisible"> class="hide">You just lost your job. Your savings account now has only 2,500. Your county just got destroyed by a hurricane. The best idea is to move out of the county. This works like real life, you will be able to invest, create things and soulotions, and make some desisions. Don't forget about your kid. Go find a house and a job. How long will you last?  </p>
